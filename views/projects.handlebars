          A simple <span>NodeJS/ExpressJS</span> grading application
          for teachers and students. I used <span>MongoDB</span>
          for database related functions, <span>HandlebarsJS</span> for
          my templating engine, and regular old <span>HTML/CSS</span>
          and <span>JavaScript</span> for everything client-side.
          Application is best viewed on mobile.

          Another small side project that was an attempt at imitating
          <a href="https://wtfsigte.com/">https://wtfsigte.com</a>, minus
          the profanity. This is basically a <span>NodeJS/ExpressJS</span>
          application that helps you find a place to eat or drink.
          Templates were created with <span>HandlebarsJS</span>
          and I utilized the <span>Yelp Search API</span> and the
          <span>Google Maps API</span> in order to obtain information.
          I used <span>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</span> for the client-side.
